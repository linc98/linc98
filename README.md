The time I owe
The light time
I could remember
Tiwtter was no longer in existence of green 
Duty to the
Time I owe
The two
Brother sent
Out to an 
Entrance of hall
One get ill
the other
Was waiting for answers
Love I will be there
Love you will go
To hell 
The devil 😈
Holds the time
God control
The time
